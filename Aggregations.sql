1) Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well as the mean amount of each paper type purchased per order. Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type for the average number of sales, as well as the average amount.

SELECT AVG(standard_qty) mean_standard, AVG(gloss_qty) mean_gloss, 
              AVG(poster_qty) mean_poster, AVG(standard_amt_usd) mean_standard_usd, 
              AVG(gloss_amt_usd) mean_gloss_usd, AVG(poster_amt_usd) mean_poster_usd
FROM orders;

2) Who was the primary contact associated with the earliest web_event?

SELECT a.primary_poc
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = w.account_id
ORDER BY w.occurred_at
LIMIT 1;

3) What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd. Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.

SELECT a.name, MIN(total_amt_usd) smallest_order
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY smallest_order;

4) Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

SELECT s.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;

5) Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

SELECT r.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;

6) Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?

SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY num_accounts;

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM sales_reps;

7) How many accounts spent more than 30,000 usd total across all orders?

SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 30000
ORDER BY total_spent;

8) Which channel was most frequently used by most accounts?

SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, w.channel
ORDER BY use_of_channel DESC
LIMIT 10;

9) Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? 

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) ord_month, COUNT(*) total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC; 

10)  The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first in your final table.

SELECT s.name, COUNT(*), SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent, 
        CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'top'
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 150 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'middle'
        ELSE 'low' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id 
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
