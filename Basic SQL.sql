1) Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order).#

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC;

2) Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by account ID (in ascending order).

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id;

3) Create a column that divides the standard_amt_usd by the standard_qty to find the unit price for standard paper for each order. Limit the results to the first 10 orders, and include the id and account_id fields.

4) Write a query that finds the percentage of revenue that comes from poster paper for each order. You will need to use only the columns that end with _usd. (Try to do this without using the total column.) Display the id and account_id fields also.

SELECT id, account_id, 
       poster_amt_usd/(standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd) AS post_per
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

5) Select all companies whose names contain the string 'one' somewhere in the name.

SELECT name
FROM accounts
WHERE name LIKE '%one%';

6) Use the web_events table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the organic or adwords channels, and started their account at any point in 2016, sorted from newest to oldest.

SELECT *
FROM web_events
WHERE channel IN ('organic', 'adwords') AND occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC;

7) Find all the company names that start with a 'C' or 'W', and the primary contact contains 'ana' or 'Ana', but it doesn't contain 'eana'.

SELECT *
FROM accounts
WHERE (name LIKE 'C%' OR name LIKE 'W%') 
              AND ((primary_poc LIKE '%ana%' OR primary_poc LIKE '%Ana%') 
              AND primary_poc NOT LIKE '%eana%');
