1) Select the id, account_id, and total variable from the orders table, then create a column called total_rank that ranks this total amount of paper ordered (from highest to lowest) for each account using a partition. Your final table should have these four columns.

SELECT id,
       account_id,
       total,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY total DESC) AS total_rank
FROM orders

2) Use the NTILE functionality to divide the accounts into 4 levels in terms of the amount of standard_qty for their orders. Your resulting table should have the account_id, the occurred_at time for each order, the total amount of standard_qty paper purchased, and one of four levels in a standard_quartile column.

SELECT
       account_id,
       occurred_at,
       standard_qty,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY standard_qty) AS standard_quartile
  FROM orders 
 ORDER BY account_id DESC
